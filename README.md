ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm J.D., a senior frontend developer / UI designer.

I work remotely full-time at Battlefield Equipment Rentals, maintaining and adding features to the front-end of web apps and company websites.

Constantly learning new technologies for my job and career advancement - currently exploring the back-end (Node.js / Express, C# / ASP.NET Core).

You can reach out by emailing me at jdfillmore.dev@gmail.com. Thanks for stopping by!
