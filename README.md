👋 Hi, I’m JD, a senior frontend developer and UI designer. I create intuitive user interfaces and build performant frontend web applications at Battlefield Equipment Rentals, while expanding into full-stack development with React, TypeScript, ASP.NET Core, and PostgreSQL. I’m also exploring Node.js and Express through side projects to broaden my backend experience.

Check out my projects on GitHub, or reach me at jdfillmore.dev@gmail.com.
