👋 Hi, I’m JD, a senior frontend developer and UI designer. I design user interfaces and build frontend web applications at Battlefield Equipment Rentals, and I’m expanding into full-stack development through internal projects using React, TypeScript, and ASP.NET Core. I’m also learning Node.js and Express through side projects.

Check out my projects on GitHub, or reach me at jdfillmore.dev@gmail.com.
