ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm JD. I'm a front-end developer with background in design.

In my current full-time remote role at Battlefield Equipment Rentals, I add features to and maintain the front-end of our web applications and company websites.

I'm a life-long learner and believe in learning technologies that will help me be better not only at my job but for my career! 

Some of those things I've dove into lately are:

- NodeJS to extend my knowledge to the back-end
- State management in React (Context API)
- TypeScript

You can reach out by emailing me at jdfillmore.dev@gmail.com. Thanks for stopping by!
