👋 Hi, I’m JD, a Full Stack Software Developer with 9 years of frontend experience and 3+ years building backend systems. I architect and build scalable, user-facing applications using React, TypeScript, Node.js, .NET Core, and PostgreSQL, delivering solutions that serve 100,000+ users and drive measurable business outcomes.

I’m passionate about end-to-end development, from designing intuitive interfaces to building performant backend APIs. I’m continuously expanding my full-stack skillset through consulting projects and production applications.
